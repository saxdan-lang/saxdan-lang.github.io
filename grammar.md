As its name suggests, Germanisch is a pan-Germanic language that draws on similarities between the three main blocks of modern Germanic languages: English, Scandinavian languages ​​and continental Germanic languages ​​(German-Dutch spectrum).

<a href="#pronunciation"><h2 id="pronunciation">Pronunciation</h2></a>

Except for borrowed words, stress always falls on the first vowel of the root. In compound words, the stress falls on the first part.

- **au** = ['aʊ]
- **c** = [s] before **e**, **i**, and **y**; before **k**, it’s [k].  
  **ch** = [tʃ]
- **e** = [e] when it’s the main stressed vowel or the first vowel of a word’s root. Otherwise, it becomes [ə] (like the “e” in “the”).  
  **ei** = [ej]
- **g** is always [g].
- **h** = [h], but if it appears inside a word’s root after a vowel, it is pronounced [x] (a rough “h” sound).
- **i** = [i];  
  **ie** = [i:] (a longer “ee” sound)
- **j** = [j] (as in “yes”)
- **ng** = [ŋ] (as in “sing”)
- **ou** = ['oʊ]
- **s** = [s], but between two vowels it changes to [z]. Double **ss** always stays [s].  
  **sch** = [ʃ] (as in “sh”)
- **u** = [u] (as in “food”)
- **w** is somewhere between [w] and [v].
- **y** = [aj] (like “eye”)

The vowels **a**, **o**, and **u** can take an umlaut (the two dots) to become **ä** [ɛ], **ö** [ø], and **ü** [y]. Umlauts can’t be added to diphthongs and long vowels, except for **äu** = [œy]. A double vowel means it’s held longer.

When adding endings, if the last vowel before the ending is an unstressed **e**, it might disappear.


<a href="#nouns"><h2 id="nouns">Nouns</h2></a>

Germanisch has two genders: common and neuter. Each noun’s gender is something you have to learn by memory. Personal pronouns are the only words that distinguish male or female for living beings.

**Definite articles:**  
- Common singular: **den**  
- Neuter singular: **dat**  
- Plural (for both genders): **de** = [də]

**Indefinite article:**  
- Singular (for both genders): **en** = [ən]

### Making Nouns Plural

1. If a noun ends in **-e**, it stays the same in plural form.
2. If a noun ends in another vowel, add **-s**.
3. If a noun comes from Latin and ends in **-um**, change **-um** to **-a**.
4. Otherwise, try to add an umlaut to the first vowel of the noun’s main part. (If it’s a compound word, look at the last part of the compound.) If that’s not possible, look at the other vowels in the root (not in endings) to see if you can add an umlaut there. This only works if the vowel you’re changing is followed by at least one consonant.

   Examples:  
   - “nose”: **nas** → **näs**  
   - “body”: **liham** → **lihäm**

   If you can’t add an umlaut, and the word is stressed on its first vowel, and the last vowel before any following consonant is an unstressed **e**, then add **-s**:

   - “finger”: **finger** → **fingers**

   For other multi-syllable words that refer to a living thing, have common gender, are stressed on the first vowel, and whose last vowel before the consonants isn’t **e**, you can add **-e**:

   - “herring”: **hering** → **heringe**

   Nouns that don’t fit any of these rules simply don’t change. This often applies to borrowed words that aren’t stressed on the first vowel:

   - “student”: **studenten** ([stu'dentən]) stays the same in plural.

If we want to especially emphasize the plural of a noun, we can add **-(e)r**. In suc
In such a case, the other plural marks at the end of the word (not the "umlauts") are dropped, as well as the unstressed final **-en**. 

Hence : **mann > männ > männer ; studenten > studenter ; finger > fingers > fing(e)rer**

Germanisch no longer really uses different noun endings for cases, except you can add a genitive **-s** (like in English or Scandinavian languages) to show possession, even to a whole phrase. A dative plural **-en** exists in a literary usage. 



<a href="#adjectives"><h2 id="adjectives">Adjectives</h2></a>

Adjectives that come after a noun (like when you say “the man is blind”) or stand on their own don’t change. Also, if an adjective ends in a vowel other than **e** or **y**, it never changes form.

However, when you put an adjective directly before a noun (like “the blind man”), you need to make it match the gender or number if the article or pronoun before it isn’t already doing that job.

- If the article or pronoun already shows gender or number, just add **-e** to the adjective.
- If it doesn’t, then:
  - For a singular common-gender noun: add **-en**
  - For a singular neuter noun: add **-t**
  - For plural nouns: add **-e**

Examples:  
- “the blind man” = **den blinde mann**  
- “the blind men” = **de blinde männ**  
- “a blind man” = **en blinden mann**  
- “blind men” = **blinde männ**

- “the good country” = **dat gude land**  
- “the good countries” = **de gude länd**  
- “a good country” = **en gudt land**  
- “good countries” = **gude länd**

### Comparative and Superlative Forms

To compare two things, add **-er ... dan** (like “bigger than”). For the “most” form, add **-(e)st** (like “biggest”). If possible, also use an umlaut on the main vowel.

Some adjectives are irregular:  
- “good”: **gud / better / best**  
- “bad”: **ivel / wärs / wärst**  
- “small”: **litel / minder / minst**

**Den grötst af jure frükt is jurn per, de minst grot jure kirsch**  
= “The largest of your fruits is your pear; the least large are your cherries.”

**Dise wo hav arbeided mest andfo de dickste frükt; dise wo hav arbeided fau andfo de minste frükt**  
= “Those who have worked the most receive the biggest fruits; those who have worked little receive the smallest fruits.”

<a href="#adverbs"><h2 id="adverbs">Adverbs</h2></a>

Adverbs generally look like the basic form of the adjective. Two exceptions:  
- **wel** = “well”  
- **ill** = “badly”

<a href="#personal-pronouns"><h2 id="personal-pronouns">Personal pronouns</h2></a>

Germanisch has personal pronouns that have a **subject form** and an **object form**, as well as a base form for making possessive pronouns and adjectives.

| Person/Number/Gender | Subject (Nominative) | Object (Oblique) | Possessive Base |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1st sing.            | ik                  | my               | my-             |
| 2nd sing.            | du                  | dy               | dy-             |
| 3rd sing. masculine  | hi                  | him              | sy-             |
| 3rd sing. feminine   | si                  | her              | her-            |
| 3rd sing. common     | den                 | den              | sy-             |
| 3rd sing. neuter     | et                  | et               | sy-             |
| 1st plural           | wi                  | os               | or-             |
| 2nd plural           | ie                  | jer              | jur-            |
| 3rd plural           | die                 | dem              | der-            |

**Notes:**
- Use **den** for common-gender nouns that don’t refer specifically to a male or female.  
- **ie** (the 2nd person plural) is also used as a polite "you" (like “vous” in French or “Sie” in German).  
- **dat** can work as a general pronoun meaning "it." It contrasts with **dis**, meaning "this." Variations of "dis" are also used for demonstrative pronouns and adjectives.
- The object form is used both for direct and indirect objects, and after prepositions.
- When both a direct and indirect object pronoun appear, the indirect object one comes first.  
  For example: **Ik giv him et** = “I give him it” or “I give it to him.”

**Reflexive Pronouns:** Use **sy** as a reflexive pronoun.  
You can also add **selv** after pronouns for emphasis (like “myself,” “yourself,” etc.).

**Possessives:**  
The possessive base (my-, dy-, sy-, etc.) can take endings (-[e]n, -t, -e) like articles do, depending on gender and number.  
For example: **Den per is myn** = “The pear is mine.”


<a href="#relative-pronouns"><h2 id="relative-pronouns">Relative pronouns</h2></a>

The general relative pronoun is formed from **welch** + an ending, meaning “which.”

Other options:
- **dat** is used for neuter singular,
- **der** for common singular (subject form),
- **wo** (subject) and **wem** (object) can be used for any gender/number, especially for people.
- Sometimes, as in English, you can leave out the relative pronoun if it doesn’t cause confusion.
- “whose” = **wes**
  
When you need to attach prepositions to a relative pronoun, you use **waar** + the preposition as a suffix (like “wherefrom,” “wherein,” etc.).



<a href="#verbs"><h2 id="verbs">Verbs</h2></a>

**Infinitives:**  
Most verbs end in **-e** in the infinitive, unless the verb root already ends in a vowel.  
Example: If the verb root is “mak-,” the infinitive is **make**. If it’s “go,” it just stays **go**.

**Present Tense and Imperative:**  
The present tense form is usually just the basic root of the verb (no final **-e**). The same form is used for the imperative (commands), except for a few irregular verbs (mostly auxiliaries and modals).

**Past Tense (Preterite) and Past Participle for Regular Verbs:**  
Regular (“weak”) verbs form the past tense and past participle by adding certain endings to the root:

- Normally, add **-de/-d**.  
- If the last consonant is a voiceless sound (f, k, p, s, sch), use **-te/-t** instead.  
- If the last consonant cluster after the vowel includes a “dental” sound (ch, d, t), use **-ed** for both past tense and past participle.

**Strong Verbs (Irregular):**  
Strong verbs change their vowel (ablaut) in the past tense and past participle. They follow patterns (like English sing/sang/sung). One set of patterns might be:  
- Class I: yC/iC:iV  
- Class IV: eC/aC/oC  
(These are just examples of vowel changes.)

**No Separate Future Tense:**  
Germanisch does not have a specific future tense. It uses modal verbs, time words (adverbs), or just the present tense if the meaning is clear.

**Conditional:**  
The language has a conditional form. To form it, start from the past tense, add an umlaut to the main vowel if possible, and end with **-e**.  
There are three irregular conditionals:  
- “would be” = **wär**  
- “should” = **schoud**  
- “would want” = **woud**

Example: **Wen ik wär rich, käupte ik en haus** = “If I were rich, I would buy a house.”

**Perfect Tense:**  
Form the perfect tense with **have + past participle** (just like English “have done,” “have seen”).

**Present Participle:**  
Add **-(e)nd** to form the present participle (like “running” from “run” → “runnd”).

**Optional Personal Endings (Old-Fashioned):**  
Modern Germanisch doesn’t usually use personal verb endings. In a more “elevated” style, you might see:  
- **-(e)st** for 2nd person singular  
- **-(e)n** for all persons plural  
- **-(e)t** for 3rd person singular present (not used with modals)  
These are optional and not common in everyday speech.

---

### The Verb “to be”

The verb “to be” = **wese** is very irregular:

- Present: **är** (except 3rd person singular = **is**)  
- Past (preterite): **was** (singular), **war** (plural)  
- Conditional: **wär**  
- Past Participle: **wesen**

---

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs express ability, permission, obligation, etc. They appear with another verb in the infinitive without “to.” They use older forms in the present (simpler forms) and change in the past:

| Infinitive | Present | Past (Preterite) | Participle | Conditional |
|------------|----------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| Bedurve (need) | bedarf | bedurft | bedurft | bedürfte |
| Döre (dare) | dör | dörd | dörd | dörde |
| Kunne (can) | kann | kunnd | kunnd | künnde |
| Moge (may) | mog | mohd | mohd | möhde |
| Muste (must) obligation | must | muste | must | müste |
| Schulle (should) advice | schall | schuld | schuld | schoud |
| Werde (become) | werd | (old plural: ward) | urden |ürde |
| Wille (want) | will | wilt | wilt | woud |
| Witte (know) | weit | wist | wist | wiste |

**Using “werde”:**  
With a past participle, **werde** translates to something like “to get something done.”  
With an infinitive, **werde** can indicate likelihood or probability about the future. In other tenses, use the conditional forms of **werde** for probabilities in past or hypothetical situations.

<a href="#numbers"><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2></a>


**Cardinal Numbers:**  
- 0 = null  
- From 1 to 12: ein, two, drie, fier, femf, sex, seven, aht, nyn, ten, elve, twalv  
- From 13 to 19, add **-tien** (like “thirteen” = dreitien)  
- 20 = twunti  
- Other tens follow the pattern: **(digit) + ti**. For example, “30” = drieti, “40” = fierti.  
- 100 = hundred  
- 1000 = tausend

For numbers above twenty, place the unit after the tens:  
- 22 = twunti-two  

**Ordinal Numbers:**  
- “first” = först  
- For other ordinals, add **-de**, but if the final consonant is voiceless, use **-te**, and if there’s a dental sound in the last cluster, use **-ste**.  


<a href="#syntax"><h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2></a>

**Basic Word Order:**  
Germanisch generally follows a **Subject – Verb – Object** word order.  
- Statement: **Ik sie den mann.** (“I see the man.”)  
- Question: **Sie ik den mann?** (“Do I see the man?”) — simply invert subject and verb.

**Highlighting/Fronting Elements:**  
You can put an important element first to emphasize it, as long as it doesn’t cause confusion. Even when you do this, try to keep the verb near the start (in second position if possible).  
- Emphasis: **Den mann sie ik.** (“The man, I see.”)

**Placement of Adjectives:**  
Adjectives usually go before the noun they describe. However, if the adjective has its own complement or a prepositional phrase, that might come after the noun.

**Negation:**  
The basic negation word is **nit**. It comes after the conjugated verb and any personal pronouns, but generally before other elements in the sentence. This placement might feel a bit different from English, which often places negation immediately after the auxiliary or modal.

Compare the following examples (without and with negation):

Without Negation:  
> Ik les dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.  
> Ik les et kwick in den skule disdag.  
> *“I read that book quickly in the school on Tuesday.”*

With Negation (**nit** after the verb and pronouns):  
> Ik les **nit** dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.  
> Ik les et **nit** kwick in den skule disdag.  
> *“I do not read that book quickly in the school on Tuesday.”*

With a Perfect Construction:  
> Ik hav lesen dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.  
> Ik hav lesen it kwick in den skule disdag.  
> *“I have read that book quickly in the school on Tuesday.”*

Negated Perfect Construction:  
> Ik hav **nit** lesen dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.  
> Ik hav **nit** lesen et kwick in den skule disdag.  
> *“I have not read that book quickly in the school on Tuesday.”*

*(In summary, if you say “I have read,” you place **nit** after “hav” and any pronoun, just before the rest of the sentence. This is a slight difference from English, where we typically say “I have not read,” placing “not” immediately after “have.” In Germanisch, the pattern is similar but the exact position of **nit** may differ slightly.)*

<a href="#derivation"><h2 id="derivation">Derivation</h2></a>

Germanisch uses many affixes (prefixes and suffixes) to create new words, much like English does, but often in a more regular way.

| Affix  | Meaning/Use                          | Example                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| -bar   | “-able”                              | lesbar (readable)       |
| -d     | quality measure (umlaut if possible) | diep → diepd (depth)    |
| -dom   | state/quality                         | gud → guddom (goodness) |
| -eer   | forms verbs from Romance words        | (French loan)           |
| -en    | causatives/adverb forms from preps    | under → unden (but "above" is **boven**           |
| -er    | agent noun                            | mak → maker (maker)     |
| -hed   | state/quality (like -hood)            |                           |
| -ing   | action noun (like English -ing)       | build → building         |
| or-    | original/from the origin prefix       | orsprong (origin)       |
| -schap | abstract noun (-ship)                 | freunschap (friendship) |
| un-    | negative prefix (un-)                 | unglad (unhappy)         |
| -wards | direction adverb (-wards)             | towards, backwards       |

The Great Invasions (5th century) : 
The situation changed at the beginning of the 5th century. On the one hand, the Roman Empire was weakened, and its division into two, in 395, mainly led to the concentration of defense resources in the East, leaving the West relatively poorly protected. On the other side, serious events are taking place in unknown lands (nowadays Poland, Ukraine, Russia): coming from Central Asia, Turko-Mongol nomads, the Huns, are riding towards the west, bringing with them vanquished peoples. With a strange appearance and a reputation for ferocity, they caused real panic among the Germanic peoples who fled before them. An enormous chaos shakes the Germanic world and throws terrified peoples seeking refuge in the Empire towards the Roman border.<br>
During the winter of 406-407, the Rhine border was forced by the Vandals near Cologne. Goths, Franks, Suevi, Alemanni, Burgundians flock to Gaul in entire tribes, with women and children. Riding south into Italy, the Visigoth Alaric took and plundered Rome in 410. In 429, the Vandal Genseric reached North Africa and conquered what is now Algeria. In 441, the Angles and Saxons occupied Brittany (present-day England) and pushed back the Celtic natives; in the 6th century, many fled to Armorica, which they made into a little Brittany.

In all the territories of their conquests, the Romans had built numerous cities which were connected by a vast network of roads. The peoples of Europe were thus able to establish fruitful commercial exchanges facilitated by the fact that they were subject to the same laws and spoke the same language. This way of life was changed by the arrival of the Germans. They were mainly devoted to agriculture and most were not interested in the great stone cities that the Romans had built. They lived in villages with houses of wood and cob. Around these villages were fields of rye, wheat or barley, and enclosures for livestock. The Germans weaved sheep's wool to make clothing. Women wore long dresses and men short shirts over pants. Jeweled brooches were used to fasten the heavy wool or fur coats that completed these outfits.

Before their coming it was called in Sindarin Amon Anwar, the Hill of Majesty, a name of which no one in Gondor knew the reason for except (as it later turned out) the Sovereign or Superintendent in exercise. For the few men who dared to stray from the Road and wander beneath the foliage, the Wood carried within itself the reason for its name, and in Common Speech it was called "Whispering Wood."

Drie ring for de elfköning under den himmel,<br>
Seven for de Dwergherrens in dere steinsäl,<br>
Nyn for de däudlige mensch,<br>
Ein for den Mörke Herren up syn mörke tron<br>
in Mordorland waar de Schadus liggen.<br>
Ein Ring tu herrsche dem äll, Ein Ring tu finde dem,<br>
Ein Ring tu bringe dem äll, oh in Mörkhed tu binde dem<br>
in Mordorland waar de Schadus liggen.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them<br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

Poème en suédois de J.Runeberg : 

När den sköna Maj med sippor kommit,
Kransa tärnor sina bruna lockar,
Skyndande till ringdans kring sin majstång.
Under dansen äro alla glada:
Glad är den, som bär ett vackert smycke,
Glad är den, hvars blomsterkrans är lyckad,
Glad är den, som känner kinden rodna.
Frågar du, hvem gladast är af alla?
Den, som ser sin fästman med i ringen.

Germanisch :
Kommen met anemone den schöne Mai
Mäid dere braune löck krans
Hastend tu den ringdans um den maimast
Alle ären glad in den dans
Glad is wo ber en smucken juvelen
Disen, wem hav lückt hern blümkrans is glad
Disen, wo fiel rodne wang heren
Wo is den glädst af alle, du frag ?
Disen, wo sie in den ring forlovd heren.
